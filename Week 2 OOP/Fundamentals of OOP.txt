6)>>Encapsulation: this is about hiding the properties, methods and values of an object from the outside
  
  >>Abstraction: this is a way of abstracting things. It is useful when in the future I want to remove a certain library from my codebase
  
  >>Inheritance: this is the "is a" and "has a" relationships between objects. With inheritance, we advocate for code reuse of similar functions.
