1)There are four fundamentals of OOP
	>> a)Encapsulation
	>> b)Data Abstraction
	>> c)Inheritance
	>> d)Polymorphism

2)There are different paradigms to use when coding. This depends on the problem
	>> a)Functional 
	>> b)OOP
	>> c)Imperative
	>> d)Logical

3)During production, multiple paradigms are being used on a single application.

4)Object Pradigms is the belief that Objects should be the fundamental building blocks of a program

5)JavaScript is a multiple paradigm programming language.

6)>>Encapsulation: this is about hiding the properties, methods and values of an object from the outside
  
  >>Abstraction: this is a way of abstracting things. It is useful when in the future I want to remove a certain library from my codebase
  
  >>Inheritance: this is the "is a" and "has a" relationships between objects. With inheritance, we advocate for code reuse of similar functions.


7)>> In object modelling we use UML(Unified Modelling Languages): You use this to establish relationships between entities without first coding

8)Methods of creating Objects
	>>a)Object literals
	>>b)Constructor Functions
	>>c)Classes
	>>d)Object.create

9)Classes give us an easy way to create Object Constructors using the class keyword

10)the delete keyword unary operator is used to delete a property from an object
	eg. delete anObject.left

11)The in keyword is used to find if a property is present in an object
	console.log("left" in anObject);

12)Two objects can refrence or bind a certain object. This means that the when we modify
	the contents of object1 we have at the same time modified the contents of object2

13)when we use == for objects, it compares only if the values are the same and if they reference the same object
