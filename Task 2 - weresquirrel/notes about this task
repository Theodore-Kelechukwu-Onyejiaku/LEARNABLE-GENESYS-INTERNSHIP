1)The log entries can be represented as an array

2)The log should contain numbers, strings and boolean. The boolean 
    is to show if he turned to a weresquirrel or not.

3)An example:
    let day1 = {
    squirrel: false,
    events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running"]
    };
    console.log(day1.squirrel);
    // â†’ false
    console.log(day1.wolf);
    // â†’ undefined
    day1.wolf = false;
    console.log(day1.wolf);
    // â†’ false

4)We use the "phi" for correlation 

5)The "phi" enables us to find if an event that occured in all 
    our arrays pushed in gives us a result whether it is likely the cause.

6)-1 means not related and 1 means related

7)formula for phi correlation(2 x 2 table) is:
    n11n00 - n10n01 / squareRoot(n1n0n1n0);

    where n11 = when squirrel, ate pizza
          n00 = when not squirrel, no pizza 
          n10 = when squirrel, no pizza
          n01 = when not squirrel, ate pizza,
          n1 = sum of second row values
          n0 = sum of first row values
          n1 = sum of second column
          n0 = sum of first column
