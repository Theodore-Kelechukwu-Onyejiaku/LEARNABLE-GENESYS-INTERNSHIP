=>An object can be created in two ways
	1)Object Literals
	2)Object Constructors

=>(1)Object Literals:
	var car = {
		name: "toyota", 
		tyres: 4, 
		doors: 4, 
		horn:
	}
=>(2)Object Constructors
	var person = new Object();
	person.name = "Theodore";
	person.lastName = "Onyejiaku";
	person.getFullname = function(){
		return this.name + this.lastName;
	}

=>Object.keys(car)
	--this will return all the keys of this object passed in.

=>Objects passed to a function are called "Objects passed by reference".
